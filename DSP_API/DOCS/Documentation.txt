DSP_API Documentation

Topic: Configuration File

The DSP_API executable requires an associated ".cfg" configuration file.
By example, the configuration file for FreeDV is FreeDV.cfg.  

The ".cfg" file must reside in the same folder as the executable.
This is currently 
    /nfsroots/microburst/home/root/
but will be changed in the future when the MODEM executables are
moved to a protected folder.

It is a text file, and can be composed with a test editor in either Unix
or Windows format.

All content prior to the '[header]' identifier will be ignored,
so any free form text can be at the top of the file, prior to the [header].

Currently, the only required [header] information is the 
"Minimum-SmartSDR-Version:"  but providing all the information
in the example is recommended.

The [setup] section contains any or all commands required to 
configure the radio for use with the MODEM.

Empty lines will be skipped.

The end of the configuration transmissions to the radio are
terminated by either the [end] identifier, or encountering the
end of file (EOF).

Any text after the [end] identifier will be ignored.
